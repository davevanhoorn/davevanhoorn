## Dave van Hoorn | [Dave.nl](https://dave.nl/)

Welcome, Dave here! For over 10 years I've been having fun writing **HTML, CSS and JavaScript** to create websites, mostly with the goal of selling products and/or services.

I've started, scaled and sold an e-commerce B2C business ([Noten.nl](https://noten.nl)) and now focus on remote **freelance and consulting** work.

My preferred stack is React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind.css and Azure DevOps, but have a history with PHP and WordPress.
